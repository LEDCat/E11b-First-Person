# E11b-First-Person

Completed the assignment, although with some difficulty. There were two problems I came across:

1) At first, I couldn't get the character camera to move. I eventually found out that there was a camera in the original World scene, which was overriding the character camera. Once I deleted it, the camera began to work.

2) I had great difficulty getting the movement to work with the original instructions that were given. I never even got the "jump" function to work, but I was able to get the character to move by using the "ui_right, ui_up, etc." functions. Although I think these are usually meant for menu navigation, it was the only way I could get my character to move.
